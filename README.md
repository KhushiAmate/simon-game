A fun memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that becomes harder with each round. Features include a responsive design, smooth animations, and easy-to-understand gameplay. A great project to practice front-end development and create an enjoyable user experience.
